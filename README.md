## 🧰 Repository Contents  
This repository contains several PHP scripts and exercises covering fundamental web-programming topics such as conditionals, loops, arrays, and simple output formatting.  
Examples include:
- `Odd-Even.php` — determines if a number is odd or even  
- `Greater Than.php` — compares two values  
- `Palindrom.php` — checks whether a string/number is a palindrome  
- `Pyramid.php`, `Pyramid 2.php` — prints pyramid patterns using loops  
- …and more.

(*See the file listing for the full set of scripts.*)

## 👨‍💻 Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- You need PHP installed (version 7.4+ is recommended)  
- A local web-server environment such as XAMPP, MAMP, WampServer or built-in PHP server  
- Optionally, a code editor like Visual Studio Code  

### Download / Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThVariableYT/Web-Programming-Practicals.git
cd Web-Programming-Practicals
```
# Setup & Run in a Local PHP Server
## Option A: Using XAMPP / WampServer / MAMP

- Install and launch your environment (Apache + PHP).

- Copy (or move) the cloned folder Web-Programming-Practicals/ into your web-server’s document root (e.g., htdocs/ for XAMPP).

- If using XAMPP on Windows: your folder might be C:\xampp\htdocs\Web-Programming-Practicals.

- In your browser navigate to:
 http://localhost/Web-Programming-Practicals/

- Click on any file (e.g., Odd-Even.php) to see its output.

## Option B: Using PHP’s built-in server

- Open a terminal inside the cloned repository folder.

Run:
```bash
php -S localhost:8080
```
- In your browser go to: http://localhost:8080

- Then navigate to the desired script (e.g., http://localhost:8080/Palindrom.php).

### 📝 How to Use the Scripts

- Browse the folder structure in your editor.

- Each PHP file is designed to be self-contained and runnable via a web-browser.

- Open the script in your browser and interact if required (input prompts, form fields may apply).

- Modify/extend the code to deepen your learning (change loop conditions, print styles, etc.).
